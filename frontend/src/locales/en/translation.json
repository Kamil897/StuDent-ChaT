        "content1": "The education system in Uzbekistan is facing a number of serious challenges. Despite ongoing reforms, schools and universities still suffer from a shortage of qualified staff, outdated teaching materials, and a lack of modern technology. The situation is especially difficult in rural and remote areas where access to quality education is limited. Many teachers continue using outdated methods, and textbooks do not meet current standards. Improving the situation requires a comprehensive strategy including investment in teacher training, curriculum updates, and infrastructure development.",
    
        "title2": "Current Situation in Schools and Universities",
        "content2": "In recent years, both the government and private initiatives have made visible efforts to improve education. Digital tools such as electronic gradebooks and online learning platforms are being implemented in schools. Universities are switching to credit-module systems, giving students more flexibility. However, teachers often struggle to adapt to these new systems. Volunteer projects, private courses, and learning centers are growing and help fill the gaps in knowledge. Still, these efforts need broader governmental support to achieve sustainable impact.",
    
        "title3": "Main Difficulties the Education System Faces",
        "content3": "Key problems include chronic underfunding, outdated facilities, and lack of ongoing training for teachers. Educational institutions are often overcrowded, especially in urban areas, leading to lower teaching quality. Additionally, many academic programs focus heavily on theory and do not provide students with practical skills for the labor market. Psychological support for students is also lacking, especially during high-pressure periods like exams. A strategic, systemic approach is necessary to overcome these challenges and ensure better learning outcomes."
